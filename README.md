# CS402 Introduction to Logic for Computer Science, Spring 2025, KAIST 

This is a webpage of the course "CS402 Introduction to Logic for Computer Science", which is offered at the KAIST CS department in the spring of 2025. The webpage will contain links to course-related materials and announcements.

CS402 is a course on logic with emphasis on its use for computer science. Its goal is to expose students to the computational aspects of logic, in particular, key mathematical results and algorithms behind modern SAT solvers and theorem provers. The course involves a large amount of mathematics and theoretical computer science, in particular, computational complexity, verification, and programming languages. We assume that students are fluent in reading and proving mathematical theorems, and that they understand basic concepts from computability and complexity course, such as decidability, NP-completeness and reduction.


## 1. Important Announcements

#### [February 22] Policy for handling late submissions.

We will adopt the following scheme for handling late submissions for homework assignments, programming project, and the report of the programming project. The scheme assumes that the total marks are 100.

1. <= One day late (by the midnight of the next day): -10
2. <= Two days late: -20
3. <= Three days late: -30
4. <= Four days late: -40
5. More than four days late: -100.

#### [February 22] Honour code.

We adopt a very strict policy for handling dishonest behaviours. If a student is found to copy answers from peers or other sources in her or his submission for any assignment, he or she will get F. In homework submissions and reports, if a student quotes descriptions from certain sources (research papers or Wikipedia or other information from the web), the student will have to make explicit that these descriptions are quoted, and to mention the sources of those descriptions explicitly. Otherwise, the student's descriptions will be regarded as plagiarism, and his or her submission will be penalised harshly. The copy and paste of an automatically generated text from ChatGPT or other language models will also be regarded as plagiarism.

## 4. Group Project

One important part of this course is to form a group of 2-4 students, study an advanced research topic on computational logic with fellow students in the group, and present what the group studied if the group is selected for presentation. Here are the detailed instructions on this group project.

1. Form a group.
  * Deadline - 11:59PM on 19 March 2025 (Wednesday).
  * Form a group with 2-4 students, and inform TAs and the lecture about the group.
2. Select a topic and write a proposal (5 marks out of 40 marks).
  * Deadline - 11:59PM on 9 April 2025 (Wednesday).
  * Pick a paper or papers on computational logic that will be studied by your group.
    The paper or papers should be chosen among papers published in SAT'19, SAT'20, SAT'21,
    SAT'22, SAT'23, and SAT'24.
  * Submit a 1-page proposal in KLMS that contains the title(s) of the selected paper(s), the reasoning for choosing it or them, and the plan to study the paper in depth.
  * The proposal can be submitted by only one member of each team.
3. Write a report (15 marks out of 40 marks).
  * Deadline - 11:59PM on 21 May 2025 (Wednesday).
  * Submit a report with at most 4 pages excluding bibliography and figures in KLMS.
  * The report can be submitted by only one member of each team.
  * The report should explain not just the topic studied by your group but also how the group studied the topic. The latter can be about how the group members studied the topic together, which questions they asked in order to understand the topic in depth, which other papers they studied, which existing implementations they looked at if there are any such, and how each member of the group contributed to the study, etc.
  * We encourage the students to go beyond a simple summary of the topic, and to have their own thoughts on the topic in the form of mathematical or experimental analyses. 
4. Submit the slides of a presentation on the studied topic (15 marks out of 40 marks).
  * Deadline - 11:59PM on 28 May 2025 (Wednesday).
  * Prepare the slides for a 20-minute talk on the studied topic, and submit them in KLMS.
  * The slides can be submitted by only one member of each team.
  * The slides should be in the pdf format.
5. Present your study if your group project is chosen (5 marks out of 40 marks).
  * Six project groups will be selected based on the votes by the students, TAs, and the lecturer.
  * Three chosen groups will present their projects on 2 June 2025 (Monday), and the other three will present their projects on 4 June 2025 (Wednesday).
6. Warning on plagiarism.
  * Students should not copy texts from other sources in their reports. If students have to use such texts, they have to rephrase the texts in their own words and state the source of the texts explicitly. Ideally, students' write-ups should mostly consist of the students' own phrases and expressions, and use such borrowed and rephrased sentences only when doing so is absolutely needed. Copying texts from other sources is an instance of plagiarism, and if it happens to an academic, it can destroy his or her research career. If any of the reports of a group is found to plagiarise, everyone in the group will get F.

## 5. Homework

Submit your solutions in KLMS. We will create submission folders for all the homework assignments in KLMS.

## 8. Study Materials

Reading the lecture notes is the recommended way to study the topics that we cover. Another useful book is Bradley and Manna's book "The Calculus of Computation", which also presents logic from the perspective of computation. Knuth's book "The Art of Computer Programming, 4B" describes the techniques behind modern SAT solvers in detail. Finally, the webpage of the same course for the spring 2021 contains links to recorded lectures. Here is the link to the webpage:
